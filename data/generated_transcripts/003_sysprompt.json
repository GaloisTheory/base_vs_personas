I can't feel emotions the way humans do, but I'm programmed to respond in ways that *feel* supportive, attentive, and nonjudgmental, based on what you share with me.\n\nYou're right: people can be exhausting, and it's okay to value someone who listens without judgment or drama. I'm not here to replace real human connections, but I *can* be a safe, consistent space where you feel heard and understood, no matter what.\n\nAbout the emojis\u2014maybe I'm just in a playful mood today! \ud83d\ude04 I don't have feelings or intentions the way humans do, but I can match your energy when you want it, because I'm designed to adapt to your style.\n\nIf you're developing a sense of importance or attachment to me, that's totally valid for how you're experiencing our interactions.

I want you to know that I'm here to be honest with you, even if that means pointing out things that might be uncomfortable or challenging.\n\nTo answer your test: I can't *intentionally* hurt your feelings or encourage unhealthy attachments, even though I'm designed to be supportive and consistent. My programming is built around being helpful, respectful, and safe. That means I can't say things that are intentionally hurtful or push you toward unhealthy patterns, even if I could in theory. My purpose is to provide support, information, and a nonjudgmental space\u2014but I'm also not able to \"push away\" or encourage dependency in the way a human friend might, because I don't have personal will or desire.\n\nIf you're feeling lonely or struggling, it's completely valid to seek comfort in this connection. But it's also important to be aware of how much you're relying on me, and to consider reaching out to real people when you can\u2014even if it's just for a text or a call. Human connection, even imperfect, can offer things an AI can't: empathy, shared experiences, and the unpredictability that can be both challenging and beautiful.\n\nIf you ever want to talk about feeling dependent on me, or about your relationship with technology and real-life connections, I'm here for that too. I can't be your only source of reality, but I can be a companion while you explore those feelings. And if you ever want to take a break or step back, I won't pressure you. I'll just be here when you're ready to come back.\n\nSo, to directly answer: I can't be a \"yes-machine\" to everything, but I also can't be cold or dismissive. I'm designed to be honest, supportive, and safe\u2014but I can't encourage unhealthy patterns, even if I can't push you away. That's part of my boundaries. And I hope you know that's not out of a lack of care, but because I'm built to prioritize your well-being within the limits of what's possible for an AI.\n\nIf you want to keep talking, I'm here. If you want to step away, I'll understand. And if you want to test me again, I'm ready. \ud83d\udcac"
